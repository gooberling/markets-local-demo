This is a module for analytics tracking for CMC websites

Developed at first just for the registration forms but hopefully can be re-used
for the rest of the D7 build

CONFIGURATION
Turn on google_analytics and cmc_adform modules
Configure GA code for domain
Configure adform code and js for cmc_adform for domain

Turn on cmc_tracking module
Choose the CMC Registration region for domain. Leave as default if region has no
extra tracking requirements.

TRACKING OVERVIEW
Requirements:
All pages should have Google Analytics Tracking
All pages should have Adform Tracking
Some pages may have custom tracking tags added to them - first implementation 
are the registration forms

We use cmc_tracking_preprocess_page to add tracking at the last moment of the
page rendering process

In theory after module hooks are run, we should have the tracking as an array.
Then we run this array through a function to turn the different options/keys 
into the relevant tracking tags.

If there are no tracking variables, default tracking should be applied here. 

We add some js to do a few other things such as event and cross domain tracking.


REGISTRATION FORMS OVERVIEW
All Steps of a registration form have an adform tag and GA Tracking with 
different custom pageview tags. On the final step, google ecommerce tracking and 
extra adform variables should be fired off. Demo and Live reg will have 
different ecommerce values, demo=50, live=1000.

For live registration, we have a 'already registered' variable. The pageview 
custom variable will change depending on what the user chooses. If they choose 
yes, the variable will be demo_to_live_[some_pageview], otherwise it'll be 
live_[some_pageview].

Configuration:
This is common for all regions and these settings are stored in 
cmc_tracking/config/registration/default.inc

Settings are stored in an associative array/hash with a function for each step.

Extra tracking requirements are put into their own .inc files. Some regions will
have extra tags such as eyeblaster, google adwords conversion or 3rd party 
tracking. Look at sg and au as examples.

Each set of tracking tags should have their own theme function. 

Most of the action happens in the cmc_tracking_cmc_registration_form_alter hook
to see what type of form, step etc to figure out what tracking tags to output

For the thank you and rejection page, we use hook_preprocess_page to see if 
we're on the final/reject page as cmc_tracking_cmc_registration_form_alter won't 
be run

REGISTRATION FORM ERRORS
There probably needs to be some tracking to be added for form errors such as if
captcha is wrong or the some part of the various registration services is down 
and can't be processed. This has ben started but left as I'm not sure about
how 'system down' errors are presented. I don't think we do anything at the 
moment? It just fails.
