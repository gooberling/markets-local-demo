In this notice, we provide you with information to help you understand the nature and risks of our financial betting products and services. However, this notice does not and cannot explain all of the risks and other significant aspects involved in financial betting. You should take sufficient time to read all the relevant information that we provide to you, including this notice, our Financial Betting Terms of Business, our Order Execution Policy Summary for Financial Betting, and the information on our website and platform. </b></p> <p><b>Financial bets carry a high risk to your capital, and you should not enter into them unless you fully understand the risks involved.

<ol>
<li><b>Betting may not be appropriate for you</b> When we process your application to open an account with us we will conduct our own assessment of whether you have sufficient knowledge and experience to understand the risks involved in financial betting, and we will inform you of the outcome of our assessment. However, our assessment does not relieve you of the need to carefully consider whether to bet using our financial betting products. If we warn you that financial betting may not be appropriate for you on the basis of your knowledge and experience, then you should refrain from entering into bets. If you nonetheless wish to enter into bets, you should only bet using the live account once you have acquainted yourself sufficiently with financial betting through the demo version and understood the risks involved. If we tell you that we have insufficient information to perform our assessment, then you should consider carefully whether you still wish to proceed with your application and start financial betting with us. </li>

<li><b>We do not provide investment, betting, tax or financial advice</b> We do not provide investment, betting, tax or financial advice relating to bets or possible bets. Any information we provide to you is purely factual and does not take into account your personal circumstances (for example, information about betting processes or minimising potential risks). </li>

<li><b>Financial bets are OTC derivatives</b> When you bet with us through our platform, you will be entering into an off-exchange (sometimes known as an ‘over-the-counter’, or ‘OTC’) derivative which is non-transferable. This means you will enter into bets directly with us, and also that those bets can only be closed with us. This involves greater risk than investing in a financial instrument such as a share which is transferable, or dealing in an exchange-traded derivative, because your ability to open and close bets is solely dependent on our platform being in a position to accept orders from you and to execute them. Therefore, you can only open and close bets on our financial betting products with us, and not anybody else. In certain circumstances it may not be possible to open or close bets with us (see paragraphs 7, 10 and 11 below). In addition, all bets that you make with us are settled in cash, and you do not have any rights to any underlying instrument. You can only profit from our financial betting products through changes in our prices, which is different from other assets, such as shares or currencies, where you can profit from real market fluctuations and where you may be entitled to dividends or interest.</li> 

<li><b>We act as a market-maker</b> Although the prices generated by our platform will take into account market data from various sources, they are not taken directly from any source. This means that our price may be different to any current exchange or market price, or another betting provider’s price, for the relevant underlying instrument. The profits or losses that you make from bets made with us will be in relation to our prices solely, and not to prices prevailing or shown anywhere else. </li>

<li><b>You may lose more than your deposit</b> When you bet with us, you risk losing more than the amount that you deposited with us. This is different to trading other types of financial instrument, for example shares, where generally you only stand to lose the amount you pay for the asset that you buy. <b><u>Although the platform has features that are designed to help minimise your risk of loss, none of these are guaranteed and you should not rely on them.</u></b> <u>Losses from your bets</u> – The amount of any loss for an individual bet will be the amount that you owe us when that bet is closed. Even over a short space of time this amount may exceed the amount of the deposit that you used to enter into the bet. This is a feature of ‘leveraged’ (also known as ‘geared’ or ‘margined’) instruments – you can lose more than your initial payment. The impact of any price movement on your account will depend on the size of your stake, rather than the amount of margin, so a small movement in price may have a large impact on your account if you have bet a large stake. In particular, when entering into short bets it is possible to lose significantly more than your initial bet since any increase in price may result in a further loss to you. To minimise losses, you should consider using stop losses so that bets are closed before your losses exceed a certain level (please note that stop losses are not guaranteed). <u>Costs incurred through betting</u> – Depending on the bets you make, and how long they last, we may require you to pay financing costs. These financing costs will be incurred on a daily basis (and are subject to amendments) when you keep a bet on certain of our products open overnight. In some cases, and particularly where you hold bets for a long time, the aggregate of these financing costs may exceed the amount of any profits or increase your loss. Please refer to our Financial Betting Terms of Business for further information on how financing costs are calculated. </li>

<li><b>Your bets are at risk of being closed automatically</b> At all times, your account value must stay above the close-out level (i.e. 20% of the total margin requirement of your open bets) otherwise all your bets may be closed by the platform. However, <b>we do not guarantee such closure and you must not rely on it</b>. It is your responsibility to monitor your positions closely and you will be able to monitor your account value through the platform. Closely monitoring your positions is very important because you might have to make immediate additional margin payments to avoid a close-out by the platform. The platform will attempt to notify you when your account value falls to 50% of the total margin requirement on your open bets, although you should not rely on the platform giving you this warning. To prevent closure of your bets, you should deposit a sufficient amount of money into your account to cover any potential losses or costs from your bets. It is important to note that even an amount that you previously deposited and which appeared to be more than sufficient at the time, can very quickly become insufficient due to rapidly changing market conditions. The automatic closure of your bets is aimed to prevent you incurring any further losses and may close all bets on your account, not just those that are making a loss. This means that your losses (and any profits) will be realised, even if the price movements against you are only temporary. In addition, if you keep the ‘transaction based stop loss’ function enabled, the platform will automatically attach a stop loss to each bet, and will seek to close any bet that incurs losses in excess of the relevant margin requirement, unless you specify otherwise. However, execution of such orders <b>is not guaranteed and you must not rely on them</b>. </li>

<li><b>Market circumstances may impact your bets</b> The ability of our platform to generate prices and execute orders is dependent on the availability of prices and liquidity in the exchanges, markets and other venues from which we gather data. In addition, because we maintain our own financial stability by hedging with other counterparties, we may be unable to execute your orders where we cannot enter into a corresponding transaction to hedge our own risk (for example, due to the activities of an issuer of shares to which your bets relate, which can sometimes restrict the market liquidity in those shares). Therefore, market circumstances may impact on your ability to place an order or close a bet with us. In contrast, if we enter into a corresponding transaction, to hedge our risk, this may have an influence on the underlying market conditions and consequently also on the prices we quote on the platform and your account. Financial markets may fluctuate rapidly and prices of our products are no exception. Any movements in our prices will have a direct and real time effect on your account. One form of price volatility that can happen regularly is called ‘gapping’. This occurs where there is a sudden shift in price from one level to another. This can be caused, for example, by unexpected economic events or market announcements, particularly where these occur outside trading hours. There may not always be an opportunity for you to place an order between the two price levels, or for the platform to execute an open order at a price between those two levels. Certain markets also have limited trading hours which can impose a significant risk to your ability to place orders and close bets. </li>

<li><b>The price of a bet may be different from the price you see on the platform when you place an order</b> There is the risk that the price which you see through your device when you place an order and on the basis of which you wish to place an order is not identical to the price at which the bet is executed, and that the corresponding difference puts you at a disadvantage. We generally attempt to generate prices on a continuous basis and to have the currently applicable prices shown on the platform as quickly as possible. However, technical conditions (e.g., the transfer rate of data networks) may lead to a change in the applicable price during the period between the time the order is placed by you and the time the relevant order is received by us or the order is executed by the platform. Such changes are based exclusively on the continuous automatic calculation of the applicable price by the platform which is based on market data of exchanges, markets and other trading, investment or betting platforms. This means such changes are indirectly based on fluctuations in the financial markets rather than on arbitrary interventions made by us. If such changes occur, the order is generally executed at the price applicable when the order is executed by the platform. Such movements in the prices may either be to your disadvantage or have a favourable impact. You can limit the effect of such movements in prices by using a boundary (on orders where this is available) or by placing a limit order. </li>

<li><b>Technical risks and other circumstances may affect your bets</b> There is a risk that other circumstances may prevent us from executing orders, or prevent you from accessing our platform. These include, for example, system errors and outages, maintenance periods, internet connectivity issues or failures of third parties on whom you or we are dependent (for example, internet service providers or electricity companies). We have business continuity measures in place to deal with some of these issues, but in some circumstances you may not be able to access the platform. These technical risks and other circumstances can pose a significant risk to the execution of your orders. </li>

<li><b>Different products pose different risks</b> We offer numerous products, which are derived from very different underlying instruments. Each of these products poses specific risks which can differ widely from other products, for instance with regard to the range and speed of price fluctuations or with respect to liquidity. Therefore, you should ensure that you understand the specific risks of a product before you open a bet on that product. Where a product is based on multiple underlying instruments (a ‘basket’ product), this will have an impact on the risk of the product. The risk involved in a basket product will depend on the risks involved in its constituents. If the basket constituents share similarities (for example they all relate to the same sector or country) then this can make the product riskier. Also, if riskier constituents are given a higher weighting within the product, this will make the product riskier. If you choose to use a basket product then you should make sure that you understand the risks involved in all the different constituents, the risks involved in the overall combination of constituents that make up the product, and the risks involved in how the constituents are given their respective weightings. </li>

<li><b>Foreign markets add further risks</b> Foreign markets will involve different risks from UK markets. In some cases those risks will be greater, for example where those foreign markets are less well supervised, have greater or more rapid market fluctuations or when those markets are less liquid. This can impair our ability to generate prices. The potential for profit or loss from bets relating to foreign markets will also be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. </li>

<li><b>You should not finance your bets with us on credit</b> If you fund your bets with us with credit (e.g. a bank loan), your risk will be significantly increased and if you make a loss using that money, you will still have to repay your credit including interest. Therefore, you must not rely on being able to redeem borrowed funds with any profits from bets with us. </li>

<li><b>Past performance does not constitute a reliable indicator of future performance</b> You should bear in mind that any past performance, simulation or prediction does not constitute a reliable indicator of future performance. Therefore, you cannot and must not rely on such past performances, simulations or predictions to indicate future performances. </li>

<li><b>We cannot guarantee protection of your money</b> If you are a retail client, money that we hold on your behalf will be held in a segregated client money bank account separate from our own money, although this may not provide complete protection (for example, if the bank that we use becomes insolvent). Money that is owed by you to us under our agreement (for example, net unrealised losses and financing costs) will be transferred from the segregated client money bank account to our own account and will then be treated as our own money (which is not subject to the FSA’s rules on client money). If you are a professional client, we will also treat any amounts required to cover your potential liabilities to us (including margin) as our own money, and not as client money. We are permitted to use this money in the course of our own business and in the event of our insolvency you will rank as a general creditor if any of this money is due back to you. </li>

<li><b>Tax treatment may vary</b> The tax treatment of your financial betting activities depends on your individual circumstances, and may be subject to change in future. </li>

<li><b> Access to the platform via mobile applications</b> The functions that enable you to access the platform via mobile applications (so-called “apps”) are not identical to the functions available to you when accessing the platform via a desktop computer. This may adversely affect your ability to take quick and reliable actions on the platform and to limit the related risks.</li>

<li><b>CFDs may not be appropriate for you</b> When we process your application to open an account with us, we will conduct our own assessment of whether you have sufficient knowledge and experience to understand the risks involved in investing in CFDs, and we will inform you of the outcome of our assessment. However, our assessment does not relieve you of the need to carefully consider whether to invest in our CFD products. If we warn you that investing in CFDs may not be appropriate for you on the basis of your knowledge and experience, then you should refrain from investing in CFDs.

Any information we provide to you is purely factual and does not take into account your personal circumstances (for example, information about trading processes or minimising potential risks). </li>

<li><b>Our CFD products are OTC derivatives</b> When you enter into any transaction with us through our platform, you will be entering into an off-exchange (sometimes known as an ‘over-the-counter’, or ‘OTC’) derivative, which is non-transferable. This means you will enter into transactions directly with us, and also that those transactions (or ‘positions’) can only be closed with us. This involves greater risk than investing in a financial instrument such as a share which is transferable, or dealing in an exchange-traded derivative, because your ability to open and close transactions is solely dependent on our platform being in a position to accept orders from you and to execute them. Therefore, you can only open and close transactions on our CFD products with us, and not anybody else.

Even over a short space of time this amount may exceed the amount of the deposit that you used to enter into the transaction. This is a feature of leveraged (also known as ‘geared’ or ‘margined’) instruments – you can lose more than your initial payment. Leverage means that you can over proportionally participate in market fluctuations (both as profits made or losses incurred). For instance: If you choose a leverage rate of 10, then any market fluctuation will have an impact which is ten times higher than if you had traded without leverage or invested directly into the underlying instrument. Consequently, the higher the leverage rate, the higher the risk involved. Therefore, the impact of any price movement on your account will depend on the transaction size as well as the leverage rate of your transaction, rather than the amount of your transaction deposit. So a small movement in price may have a large impact on your account if you have entered into a large transaction on margin. In addition, when entering into short transactions it is possible to lose more than the transaction value, since any increase in price may be more than the price at which you opened the transaction. Therefore, short transactions can be riskier than long transactions. <u>Costs incurred through investing</u> - Depending on the transactions you enter into, and how long you hold them for, we may require you to pay transaction holding costs. These transaction holding costs will be incurred on a daily basis (and are subject to amendments) when you keep a transaction on certain of our products open overnight. In some cases, and particularly where you keep transactions open for a long time, the aggregate of these transaction holding costs may exceed the amount of any profits or increase your loss. Please refer to our CFD Terms of Business for further information on how transaction holding costs are calculated. </li>
