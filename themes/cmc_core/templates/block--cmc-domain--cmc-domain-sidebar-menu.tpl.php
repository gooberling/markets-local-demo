 * Menu blocks are best served up a <nav>. Most of the time menus really are
 * menus and HTML5 gives us the <nav> element to mark them up. Drupal gives us
 * template suggestions so I am using one here to target menu blocks. Note
 * however that not all menus are Menu module menus, we need some preprocessing
 * to make sure the Main menu and others use this template.
